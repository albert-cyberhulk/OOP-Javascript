My Personal Tests With OOP in Javascript

In this Project you will find most of the famous OOP paterns used in Javascript.

Basically ECMA-262 defines an object as an ‚Äúunordered collection of properties each of which contains 
a primitive value, object, or function.‚Äù Strictly speaking, this means that an object is an 
array of values in no particular order. Each property or method is identified by a name that 
is mapped to a value. For this reason (and others yet to be discussed), it helps to think of 
ECMAScript objects as hash tables: nothing more than a grouping of name-value pairs where 
the value may be data or a function.
Each object is created based on a reference type, either one of the native types discussed in the 
previous chapter, or a developer-defined type.

In this Project you will see how various and exciting can be OOP Implementations in Javascript.
 
Project includes the following files with corresponding functionality:

    1. objectLiteral.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Object Literal OOP patern and Object.defineProperty Implementations
    
    2. factoryPattern.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Factory OOP patern
    
    3. constructorPattern.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Constructor OOP patern
    
    4. prototypePattern.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Prototype OOP patern
        
    5. constructorPrototypePattern.js -> Contains logic with Javascript mixed Constructor - Prototype Pattern

    6. dynamicPrototypePattern.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Dynamic Prototype Pattern
    
    7. parasiticConstructorPattern.js -> Contains logic with Parasitic Constructor Pattern

    8. durableConstructor.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Durable Constructor Pattern

    9. prototypeChaining.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Prototype Chaining Inheritance Pattern
    
    10.combinationInheritance.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Combination Inheritance Pattern
	
    11.prototypalInheritance.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Prototypal Inheritance Pattern
	
    12. objectCreate.js -> Contains logic with Javascript Object.create Inheritance Pattern
