OOP-Javascript

My Personal Tests With OOP in Javascript

In this Project you will find most of the famous OOP paterns used in Javascript.

Basically ECMA-262 defines an object as an “unordered collection of properties each of which contains 
a primitive value, object, or function.” Strictly speaking, this means that an object is an 
array of values in no particular order. Each property or method is identified by a name that 
is mapped to a value. For this reason (and others yet to be discussed), it helps to think of 
ECMAScript objects as hash tables: nothing more than a grouping of name-value pairs where 
the value may be data or a function.
Each object is created based on a reference type, either one of the native types discussed in the 
previous chapter, or a developer-defined type.

In this Project you will see how various and exciting can be OOP Implementations in Javascript.
 
Project includes the following files with corresponding functionality:

    #1 "objectLiteral.js" :{
        //Contains logic with Object Literal javascript OOP patern and Object.defineProperty Implementations
    }
    
    #2 "factoryPattern.js" : {
        
    }
